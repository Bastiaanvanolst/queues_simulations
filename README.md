This repo contains a number of tutorials to simulate queueing process
with python.  The tutorial text and exercises can be found in
`tutorial_a4.pdf`, or  `tutorial_mobile.pdf` if you like to read it on
a device with a small screen such as a cell phone.  The final code is
in available in the form of python programs, with extension `.py`,
and, for the first three tutorials as Jupyter notebooks, with
extension `.ipynb`.

The tex files in `tex_files` contain all python source code.
To extract the python code I use `tangle.py`.
Then I convert the python program into notebooks with `ipynb-py-convert`.
