This repo contains a number of tutorials to simulate queueing process with python.
The tutorial text and exercises can be found in `tutorial_a4.pdf`, or `tutorial_mobile.pdf` if you like to read it on
a device with a small screen such as a cell phone.  

All python code is in available in `python_files`, the first three tutorials as available as Jupyter notebooks in `noteboks`.

The tex files in `tex_files` contain all python source code.
To extract the python code I use `tangle.py`.
Then I convert the python program into notebooks with `ipynb-py-convert`.
